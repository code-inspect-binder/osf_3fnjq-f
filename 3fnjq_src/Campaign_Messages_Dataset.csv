The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the largest free-trade agreement in history, represented by a 12-nation market of nearly 800 million customers. 

This agreement will protect and create new, well-paying jobs in Canada, and will grow every sector of our economy by giving Canadian businesses access to some of the fastest-growing new markets in the world.

Canada is now the only G7 nation with free trade access to all of the US and Americas, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region – that’s over 60% of the world’s economy.

"9106562109","Stephen Harper","Today I’m in Montreal preparing for tomorrow’s Leader’s debate.  As I reflect on the last seven weeks of travelling across the country and meeting Canadians it’s remarkable how everywhere I go, people are saying the same things. They’re concerned about global economic instability.  They want to know that their job or their business and most of all their families, will be protected. 
 
That’s why our plan to protect our economy is so important.  Our plan will create jobs.  In fact, as I announced yesterday in Winnipeg, our goal is to create another 1.3 million new jobs in Canada by the year 2020.  
 
And our plan gives taxpayers peace of mind because a Conservative government will not raise taxes.  Canadians work hard to make ends meet, and we know that  your money belongs to you, not politicians or bureaucrats in Ottawa. That’s why we’ve lowered taxes why we will keep them low.  We can promise low taxes because we only make promises we can afford,  we spend prudently, and we’ll maintain our balanced budgets. 
 
The other guys have made a lot of promises in this campaign, but it always boils down to this: they will take more money out of your pocket and off your paycheque. They will spend billions more than we can afford and expose our fragile economy at a time of global economic uncertainty.  That is not the way to move Canada’s economy forward. That is not the way to ensure our continued prosperity.

Our seniors have worked hard and saved their entire lives, and our Conservative Party knows that they are best able to make decisions about their future and retirement. Already, we’ve made changes that have taken about 400,000 seniors completely off the tax rolls. And there is more to do.
 
Today, we are announcing a $2,000 “equivalent-to-spouse” Pension Income Credit (PIC) that will help nearly 1.6 million single Canadian seniors. When combined with the existing PIC, it will mean up to $600 in tax relief every year. 
 
The Liberals and NDP have a clear record of opposing the initiatives we have put forward to support older Canadians. Their unaffordable promises will mean higher taxes and less money for seniors struggling to make ends meet. Instead of creating expensive programs that will hike their taxes even higher, our low-tax Conservative plan helps them keep more of their money to spend on the priorities they choose.

Today Finance Canada confirmed, that under our Conservative government’s careful economic stewardship, we balanced the budget a full year early with almost a $2 billion surplus in 2014-15. We’ve accomplished this while lowering taxes, increasing benefits for families, and investing in infrastructure.

Now, we need to keep moving our economy forward.

A balanced budget is the foundation of our economic plan. With it, we can continue to lower taxes and invest in Canadian families.

The alternative is clear – both the Liberals and NDP would run deficits and hike taxes on Canadians. This would expose our fragile economy to the global uncertainty all around us.

"9106562109","Stephen Harper","Supporting children with disabilities was an important cause for my friend Jim Flaherty. It was thanks to him that we created the Registered Disability Savings Plan, or RDSP. It is the first initiative of its kind in the world. And it is working -- Canadians have opened more than 100,000 RDSPs since they were created in 2008.

I believe it can be even better, which is why we will increase the maximum annual donation to RDSPs for lower- and middle-income families from $3,500 to $4,000.

This means that we’re actually ahead of the game on our plan, while at the same time delivering historic tax relief directly to Canadian families.

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","A Liberal government will tap into the immense talent of Canada's public servants. Read my open letter:

""Over the past three years, I have had the opportunity to travel across our great country, visiting communities large and small, and speaking to Canadians about their priorities and concerns. Many of those conversations – in places like Charlottetown, or Shawinigan, or Victoria – were with members of Canada’s proud and dedicated public service. I know that each and every time a government employee comes to work, they do so in service to Canada, with a shared mutual goal of improving our country and the lives of all Canadians.  

Today, I am writing to you concerning the Liberal Party of Canada’s position on several issues that may be important to you – as a federal public servant – during this election. Respect and trust for our public servants by the federal government has never been so low, and I want to take this opportunity to assure you that I have a fundamentally different view than Stephen Harper of our public service.

Where he sees an adversary, I see a partner. I believe that in order to have a public service that is valued by Canadians, and a source of pride for its members, it must be valued by its government. That begins with – and necessitates – respecting the labour rights of public servants, and trusting in their ability to provide effective, independent, and professional services for Canadians.

 Sick Leave

As Liberals, we understand that modern workplaces must be flexible enough to accommodate unexpected absences – taking time off to care for a sick child, attending a doctor’s appointment, or working from home while on bedrest. Employers should continually look for opportunities to improve the benefits that employees receive, but these benefits should not be unilaterally imposed by employers, or taken away, without proper negotiation.

 The Liberal Party of Canada opposed the provisions in the Conservatives’ Bill C-59, which will create a new sick leave regime, implemented through legislation, completely outside the collective bargaining process. Responsible government must respect the union negotiation process and finalize its financial plans upon completion of negotiations, not at the beginning.

The Harper Conservatives have not justified why they plan to make changes to public sector sick leave. A Liberal government would review the bargaining mandate to ensure that it is fair and reasonable for the public service and all Canadians.

A Liberal government is committed to bargaining in good faith with public sector unions, and the Liberal Party of Canada remains strongly committed to supporting and protecting workers’ rights. In order for workers and employers, society, and the economy-at-large to prosper, we need fair and balanced labour laws that respect due process and are developed through real consultation.

Mental Health

Canada is facing a growing mental health crisis; during their lifetimes, one in five Canadians will experience a mental health issue. It is crucial that we foster a welcoming environment for free and frank discussion, and the federal government has a vital leadership role to play in improving mental health support for Canadians. As the country’s largest employer, it must begin by tackling the challenges of mental illness, which account for almost half of its disability claims.

 I was encouraged earlier this year when a Joint Task Force on Mental Health was created by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the federal Treasury Board. I fully support this type of collaborative process and commit to implementing the Mental Health Commission of Canada’s National Standard of Canada for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace. Supporting this standard is good for the employee, the workplace, and the employer.

 Better Service for Canadians

 In a digital era, citizens expect better service from their government. Our world has been changing rapidly, but our federal government has not. During the Harper decade, services for Canadians have been continuously degraded – whether it is veterans seeking benefits, Canadian workers in need of help through Employment Insurance, individuals trying to help their relatives immigrate to Canada – even going so far as asking Canadians to pay more, for fewer services, from Canada Post.

A Liberal government will work with our dedicated public service to provide the quality of service Canadians expect and deserve. We will introduce a significant overhaul of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), including doing more to combat international tax evasion, and ending the political harassment of charities. We will also stop the Harper Conservatives’ plan to end door-to-door mail delivery and ensure Canadians receive the postal service on which they rely. Our commitment to better service will also respect our sacred obligation to care for the wellbeing of our troops, veterans, and their families, including by reopening the nine veterans’ service centres closed by Harper. The Liberal Party believes in the importance of the Official Languages Act and remains committed to a bilingual public service. 

Further, a Liberal government will create new performance standards for services offered by the federal government. We will start with veterans’ services, immigration processing, Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan processing, and appeals at the Social Security Tribunal. After years of cuts by Stephen Harper and his Conservatives, increasing numbers of Canadians are not receiving timely access to needed services. 

Canadians also expect their government to produce policies and programs based on facts. Replacing the long-form census with the National Household Survey is another example of the Harper Conservatives’ short-sighted and ideological approach to governing. This policy hurts Canadians and the government programs and services on which they rely. A Liberal government will immediately restore the mandatory long-form census and make Statistics Canada fully independent. We will ensure evidence-based decision-making is once again a guiding principle of the Canadian government.

The muzzling of scientists and the Conservative suppression of scientific information is an assault on democracy and an embarrassment to Canada on the international stage. The Liberal Party of Canada is committed to revoking the rules and regulations that muzzle government scientists and allow them to speak freely about their work, with only limited and publicly-stated exceptions. In addition, we will consolidate government science so that it is easily available to the public at-large through a central portal.

Further to this, should the Liberal Party of Canada form the next government, we will create a Chief Science Officer, whose mandate will include ensuring that government science is freely available to the public, that scientists are able to speak freely about their work, and that scientific analyses are appropriately considered when the government makes decisions.

 Anti-Public Service Legislation

While the middle class is struggling to make ends meet, Stephen Harper’s plan has failed to help hard-working Canadians get ahead. Instead, the Harper Conservatives have rolled back many fundamental labour rights that affect workers’ ability to organize freely, bargain collectively in good faith, and work in a safe environment.

Only Liberals have the team and the plan to support and protect hard-working Canadians and their families. If elected, a Liberal government will be committed to restoring fair and balanced labour laws that respect the integral role played by unions in our society, and their importance to middle class prosperity.

Changes made to the collective bargaining rights in the Conservatives’ omnibus budget Bill C-4 stacked the deck against workers with regards to their choice of dispute resolution and arbitration.

Short-sighted labour changes – driven by ideology rather than evidence, and made without a legitimate consultative process – are both disruptive and unsustainable. We will consult with public sector partners, and revisit the offending C-4 legislation.

If real change is to occur after October 19, a valued, independent, and professional public service will be needed to implement it. From food safety, to stronger environmental protections, to ensuring benefits arrive on time for our most vulnerable community members – a strong public service is an important part of what makes Canada the envy of the world. 

All my life, I have been guided by the value of public service. I believe it is time to restore trust in – and respect for – our public servants. I hope to have the honour of working with you to build an even greater country, together.""

Sincerely,

Justin Trudeau
Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada",2015-09-27 23:19:34,"status",NA,"21751825648_10153754191480649",2188,184,589,2015-09-27,"23:19:34","September","Week 8"
"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","Un gouvernement libéral utilisera les talents considérables des fonctionnaires canadiens. Lisez ma lettre ouverte :

« Au cours des trois dernières années, j’ai eu l’occasion de voyager dans notre beau pays, de visiter des collectivités grandes et petites et de parler aux Canadiens de leurs priorités et de leurs préoccupations. J’ai souvent engagé la conversation – dans des villes comme Charlottetown, Shawinigan ou Victoria – avec des membres fiers et dévoués de la fonction publique canadienne. Je sais que chaque fois qu’un employé de l’État se rend à son travail, il le fait pour servir le Canada, dans l’objectif  commun d’améliorer notre pays et la vie de l’ensemble de la population.

Aujourd’hui, je vous écris pour vous exposer la position du Parti libéral du Canada sur plusieurs enjeux qui, en tant que fonctionnaires fédéraux, peuvent vous sembler importants durant ces élections. Le gouvernement n’a jamais eu si peu de respect et de confiance envers les fonctionnaires, et je tiens à profiter de cette occasion pour vous assurer que la vision que je me fais de notre fonction publique diffère fondamentalement de celle de Stephen Harper.

 Là où il voit un adversaire, je vois un partenaire. J’estime qu’une fonction publique appréciée des Canadiens, qui est aussi une source de fierté pour ses membres, doit être appréciée par son gouvernement. La condition préliminaire – et indispensable – est le respect des droits des fonctionnaires et la confiance en leur capacité à procurer des services efficaces, indépendants et professionnels aux Canadiens.

 Congés de maladie

 En tant que libéraux, nous comprenons qu’un milieu de travail moderne doit être assez souple pour s’adapter aux absences imprévues – pour prendre soin d’un enfant malade, se rendre à un rendez-vous chez le médecin ou travailler à domicile en cas d’alitement. Les employeurs doivent sans cesse chercher des occasions d’améliorer les avantages sociaux dont bénéficient les employés, sans qu’ils leurs soient imposés unilatéralement par les employeurs, ou qu’ils leurs soient repris sans négociations adéquates.

Le Parti libéral du Canada s’est opposé aux dispositions du projet de loi conservateur C-59, qui crée un nouveau régime de congés de maladie, mis en application par voie législative, complètement en dehors du processus de négociation collective. Un gouvernement responsable doit respecter le processus de négociations syndicales et finaliser ses plans financiers à la fin des négociations, et non au début.

Le gouvernement de M. Harper n'a pas motivé les changements qu'il planifie d'effectuer en matière de congés de maladie de la fonction publique. Un gouvernement libéral révisera le mandat de négociation pour s'assurer qu'il soit équitable et raisonnable pour la fonction publique et pour toutes les Canadiennes et tous les Canadiens.

Un gouvernement libéral s’engage à négocier de bonne foi avec les syndicats de la fonction publique et le Parti libéral du Canada reste résolument engagé à soutenir et à protéger les droits des travailleurs. Pour assurer la prospérité des travailleurs et des employeurs, de la société et de l’économie dans son intégralité, nous devons avoir une législation du travail juste et équilibrée, qui respecte l’application régulière de la loi, et qui est élaborée dans le cadre de véritables consultations.

Santé mentale

Le Canada est confronté à une crise de plus en plus grave dans le domaine de la santé mentale. Une personne sur cinq au Canada sera touchée par un problème de santé mentale à un moment ou à un autre de sa vie. Il est crucial de créer des conditions qui laissent libre cours à une discussion franche et honnête sur cette question, et il revient au gouvernement fédéral de jouer le rôle essentiel de leader pour améliorer le soutien en matière de santé mentale pour tous les Canadiens. Étant le plus grand employeur au pays, il doit relever les défis que posent les maladies mentales, qui représentent presque la moitié des demandes de prestations d’invalidité.

J’ai été encouragé plus tôt cette année par la création d’un groupe de travail mixte sur la santé mentale entre l’Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada et le conseil du Trésor fédéral. J’appuie sans réserve ce type de processus collaboratif et m’engage à mettre en œuvre la Norme nationale du Canada sur la santé et la sécurité psychologiques en milieu de travail élaborée par la Commission de la santé mentale du Canada. Appuyer cette norme est bénéfique pour l’employé, le milieu de travail et l’employeur.

Un meilleur service pour les Canadiens

À l’ère du numérique, les citoyens s’attendent à un meilleur service de la part de leur gouvernement. Notre monde évolue rapidement, mais notre gouvernement fédéral ne suit pas. Durant la décennie de pouvoir de M. Harper, les services procurés aux Canadiens n’ont cessé de se dégrader, que ce soit les anciens combattants qui réclament des prestations, les travailleurs canadiens qui ont besoin d’aide au niveau de l’assurance-emploi, des personnes voulant aider leurs proches à immigrer au Canada, ou encore des Canadiens à qui on demande de payer davantage pour obtenir moins de services de la part de Postes Canada.

Un gouvernement libéral collaborera avec nos fonctionnaires dévoués pour procurer la qualité de service auxquels les Canadiens sont en droit de s’attendre. Nous procéderons à de sérieux changements dans les pratiques de fonctionnement de l’Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC), notamment en redoublant d’efforts pour lutter contre l’évasion fiscale internationale et en cessant le harcèlement envers les organismes de bienfaisance pour des raisons politiques. Nous annulerons la décision des conservateurs de M. Harper de mettre fin à la distribution du courrier à domicile et veillerons à ce que les Canadiens bénéficient du service postal sur lequel ils comptent. Notre engagement envers un meilleur service respectera également notre obligation solennelle de veiller au bien-être de nos soldats et anciens combattants, ainsi que de leurs familles, notamment en rouvrant les neuf centres de services aux anciens combattants fermés par M. Harper. Le Parti libéral du Canada croit en l’importance de la Loi sur les langues officielles et tient au bilinguisme de la fonction publique. 

En outre, un gouvernement libéral créera de nouvelles normes de rendement pour les services qu’offre le gouvernement fédéral. Nous commencerons avec les processus entourant les services aux anciens combattants, le traitement des demandes d’immigration, le traitement des demandes d’assurance-emploi et des dossiers du Régime de pensions du Canada, ainsi que les appels devant le Tribunal de la sécurité sociale. Après plusieurs années de compressions effectuées par Stephen Harper et son gouvernement conservateur, de plus en plus de Canadiens ne bénéficient pas en temps opportun de l’accès aux services dont ils ont besoin.

Les Canadiens s’attendent aussi à ce que leur gouvernement mette en œuvre des politiques et des programmes qui se fondent sur des faits. Le remplacement du questionnaire détaillé de recensement par l’Enquête nationale auprès des ménages est un autre exemple du manque de vision du gouvernement conservateur de M. Harper et de sa gestion basée sur l’idéologie. Cette politique nuit aux  Canadiens ainsi qu’aux programmes et services gouvernementaux desquels ils dépendent. Un gouvernement libéral rétablira immédiatement le questionnaire détaillé obligatoire du recensement et donnera plus d’indépendance à Statistique Canada. Nous nous assurerons que la prise de décisions basée sur des faits est de nouveau un principe directeur au gouvernement du Canada.

 Le bâillonnement des scientifiques et le camouflage de renseignements scientifiques de la part des conservateurs constituent une atteinte à la démocratie et sont une source d’embarras pour le Canada sur la scène internationale. Le Parti libéral du Canada s’est engagé à annuler les règles et les règlements qui bâillonnent les scientifiques du gouvernement afin que ceux-ci puissent parler librement de leurs travaux, exception faite de rares cas qui seront signalés publiquement. De plus, nous regrouperons dans un portail central les travaux scientifiques du gouvernement afin qu’ils soient facilement accessibles au grand public.

 En outre, si le Parti libéral du Canada forme le prochain gouvernement, nous créerons le poste de directeur scientifique, dont le mandat sera notamment d’assurer que les travaux scientifiques du gouvernement sont accessibles au public gratuitement, de permettre aux scientifiques de parler librement de leur travail, et de veiller à ce que le gouvernement tienne bien compte des analyses scientifiques lorsqu’il prend des décisions.

Législation défavorable à la fonction publique

 Alors que les Canadiens de la classe moyenne peinent à joindre les deux bouts, le plan de M. Harper n’a rien fait pour améliorer leur sort. Au contraire, le gouvernement conservateur est revenu sur un grand nombre de droits fondamentaux en matière de travail, ce qui a eu des répercussions sur la capacité des travailleurs de se syndiquer librement, de négocier collectivement de bonne foi, et de travailler dans un environnement sécuritaire.

Seuls les libéraux ont l’équipe et le plan qu’il faut pour soutenir et protéger les travailleurs canadiens ainsi que leur famille. S’il est élu, le gouvernement libéral s’engage à rétablir des lois du travail justes et équilibrées et qui respectent le rôle essentiel des syndicats au sein de notre société, ainsi que leur importance pour la prospérité de la classe moyenne.

Les modifications apportées aux droits à la négociation par le projet de loi omnibus C-4 des conservateurs faussent le jeu au détriment des travailleurs quant au choix du mode de résolution des différends et à l’arbitrage.

Les modifications à courte vue défavorables aux travailleurs – basées sur l’idéologie plutôt que sur des données probantes et apportées sans processus consultatif légitime – sont à la fois perturbantes et insoutenables. Nous consulterons les partenaires de la fonction publique et réexaminerons les dispositions du projet de loi C-4.

Si nous sommes pour changer ensemble après le 19 octobre, pour y parvenir, nous aurons besoin du précieux appui des professionnels d’une fonction publique indépendante. De la sécurité alimentaire à des mesures de protection de l’environnement renforcées, en passant par l’assurance que les prestations sont acheminées à temps aux membres des communautés les plus vulnérables, une fonction publique forte est un élément important de ce qui fait que le Canada est si envié dans le monde entier.

Toute ma vie, j’ai été guidé par les valeurs du service public. Je suis convaincu que le moment est venu de restaurer la confiance dans nos fonctionnaires – et le respect que nous leur portons. J’espère avoir l’honneur de collaborer avec vous pour bâtir, ensemble, un pays encore plus fort. »

Cordialement,

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","From my open letter to Stephen Harper, Thomas Mulcair and Elizabeth May on the refugee crisis in Syria:

The tragic humanitarian crisis in Syria has broken the hearts of Canadians across the country and the global community at large. We know that Canada can, and must, do more to offer safe haven to the men, women, and children who are seeking asylum from persecution and displacement.

Municipal and provincial leaders have already taken action, as have many Canadians. It is time for us, as federal leaders, to step up and do more. As of October 19th, there will be a government with a new mandate to address this crisis, but we cannot stand idly by in the meantime.

Canadians rightly expect more from their leaders. That is why I am proposing that we sit down in collaboration to discuss the best course of action for Canada going forward, and develop a concrete plan for the weeks and months ahead. We must put partisanship aside and avoid becoming mired in the
politics of this crisis. 

We have a responsibility to expand our current refugee targets. Let us work together to ensure we are doing all we can to help Syrian refugees who are so desperately seeking safety in Canada.",2015-09-07 12:32:40,"status",NA,"21751825648_10153701538200649",6038,921,1027,2015-09-07,"12:32:40","September","Week 6"

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","My thoughts on balancing the budget and investing to grow Canada’s economy:

The news about the economy isn’t good, and it’s getting worse by the day.

When asked about the economy, Stephen Harper’s only response is that we need to stick with the status quo, but let’s take a look at where this has taken us.

Under Stephen Harper, we’ve seen:

- Eight consecutive deficits;

- Two recessions, one of them unique to Canada; and

- The worst decade of growth since the Great Depression.

And what’s his plan? Continue sending government cheques to millionaires with kids, while ignoring the middle class – and Thomas Mulcair agrees with him.

We think there’s a different way – a better way.

While our opponents have chosen austerity and cuts that will slow our economy further, we’re choosing smart investments that create jobs and growth.

Our plan will invest $60 billion new dollars in infrastructure over 10 years, almost doubling Stephen Harper’s planned investment.  This will be the largest infrastructure investment in Canadian history.

Our plan will focus on three areas that will create economic growth now, and make our economy more productive over time: public transit, social infrastructure, and sustainable infrastructure.

We need greater investment in public transit.  If we want our economy to grow, we need our cities to work.

We need to invest in social infrastructure, in things like affordable housing and childcare.  Our communities cannot grow without them.

And we need to build sustainable infrastructure.  This means investing in clean energy, but it also means adapting to climate change.

And while we know that now is the time to invest in our future, we also know that fiscal responsibility is important.  Our plan will reduce our federal debt-to-GDP ratio every year, and return our budget to balance by 2019.

Canada was built around meaningful infrastructure investments; The Canadian Pacific Railway, the St. Lawrence Seaway, the TransCanada Highway – none of these things would have happened without smart and sustained federal investment, strong leadership and the support of inspired Canadians.

Together, we will build a better country.",2015-08-27 23:31:46,"status",NA,"21751825648_10153676334355649",5591,507,1441,2015-08-27,"23:31:46","August","Week 4"
"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","Mon opinion sur l’équilibre budgétaire et les investissements pour faire croître l’économie du Canada:

Les nouvelles sur l’économie ne sont pas rassurantes et elles le sont de moins en moins. Quand on lui pose la question au sujet de l’économie, Stephen Harper n’a qu’une seule réponse à offrir : nous devons nous en tenir au statu quo. Alors, voyons où cela nous a menés.

Sous l’administration Harper, nous avons eu :

- huit déficits consécutifs;

- deux récessions, dont une n’a sévi qu’au Canada; et

- la pire décennie en termes de croissance depuis la Grande Dépression.

Et, son plan? Continuer d’envoyer des chèques du gouvernement aux millionnaires qui ont des enfants, tout en ignorant la classe moyenne. Un plan qui reçoit l’approbation de Thomas Mulcair.

Nous croyons qu’il existe une autre façon de faire les choses, une meilleure façon.

Alors que nos adversaires ont choisi l’austérité et les coupures budgétaires qui ralentiront encore plus notre économie, nous avons opté pour des investissements intelligents qui créeront des emplois et de la croissance.

Avec notre plan, nous investirons 60 milliards de nouveaux dollars en infrastructures sur 10 ans, soit presque le double des investissements prévus par Stephen Harper. Il s’agira du plus grand investissement en infrastructure de l’histoire du Canada.

Notre plan se concentrera sur trois domaines qui créeront, aujourd’hui, de la croissance économique et rendront notre économie plus productive : le transport en commun, les infrastructures sociales et les infrastructures durables.

Nous devons investir plus dans le transport collectif. Si nous voulons faire croître notre économie, nos villes doivent fonctionner.

Nous devons investir dans les infrastructures sociales, tels le logement abordable et les garderies. Nos communautés ne peuvent se développer sans cela.

Et, nous devons bâtir des infrastructures durables. Ce qui signifie investir dans l’énergie propre, mais aussi s’adapter aux changements climatiques.

Alors que nous savons qu’il faut investir aujourd’hui pour demain, nous savons aussi que la responsabilité financière est importante. Notre plan vise à réduire annuellement le rapport entre la dette fédérale et le PIB et à revenir à un budget équilibré en 2019.

Le Canada s’est bâti grâce à des investissements en infrastructure majeurs. Le chemin de fer du Canadien Pacifique, la voie maritime du Saint-Laurent, l’autoroute transcanadienne, autant de projets qui n’auraient pas vu le jour sans l’apport d’investissements intelligents et durables du gouvernement fédéral, d’un leadership fort et de l’appui de Canadiennes et Canadiens visionnaires.

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","My letter to the Prime Minister:

Prime Minister,

Evidence presented at the Mike Duffy trial demonstrates there was an attempt by members of your staff to cover-up Mr. Duffy’s expenses and then provide a false version of events to Parliament and to Canadians.

Your staff tried to end an independent audit by Deloitte, they manipulated a Senate report, and they crafted talking points about these events that were simply not true – including the details of Nigel Wright’s $90,000 cheque to Mike Duffy. The e-mails demonstrate that senior members of your current campaign team, including Marjory LeBreton, Irving Gerstein, and Ray Novak, were a part of these activities.

This evidence is raising extremely serious questions about your judgement and your public statements to this point.

1. You stated during the first leaders’ debate of this election campaign: “When bad actions arise, the role of the leader is to take responsibility and hold people accountable.” If you stand by that statement, and if you have any respect left for the office that you are privileged to currently hold – why have you not already fired the members of your team who were involved in these activities?

2. You stood in the House of Commons and said Nigel Wright’s decision to write a $90,000 cheque was “not communicated to me or to members of my office.” Yet evidence at court shows that Nigel Wright e-mailed the PMO’s lawyer, Benjamin Perrin, and your current Chief of Staff, Ray Novak, indicating he was sending a personal cheque. As this evidence was made public in recent days, you now say that the “vast majority” of your staff was unaware of Nigel Wright’s cheque. Who specifically was aware? Were you aware that your first statement was false when you made it?

3. With respect to the $90,000 cheque, in 2013, you said: “On Wednesday, May 15, I was told about it.” The next day your office released a statement saying Nigel Wright “has the confidence of the Prime Minister” and “he will not resign.” Months later you then said “he was dismissed.” If you dismissed Nigel Wright, why did your office release a statement saying that he had your confidence?

4. Have you, or any members of your staff, had any contact with Nigel Wright on any government business since he left your office on May 19, 2013?

Canadians deserve answers to these questions – answers that you have refused to provide.

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","Ma lettre au premier ministre :

Monsieur le Premier Ministre,

La preuve présentée au procès de Mike Duffy démontre qu’il y a eu tentative de la part de votre personnel de camoufler les dépenses de M. Duffy et qu’une fausse version des faits a été donnée au Parlement et aux Canadiennes et Canadiens.

Votre personnel a tenté de mettre un terme à la vérification externe de Deloitte, il a manipulé un rapport du Sénat et élaboré des argumentaires tout simplement faux en réponse à ces événements, incluant les détails du chèque de  90 000 $ de Nigel Wright à Mike Duffy. Les courriels révèlent que des têtes dirigeantes de votre équipe de campagne électorale actuelle, dont Marjory LeBreton, Irving Gerstein et Ray Novak, étaient impliquées dans ces activités.

Cette preuve soulève des doutes quant à votre capacité de jugement et à vos déclarations publiques à ce jour.

1. Lors du premier débat des chefs de la campagne électorale en cours, vous avez déclaré ceci : « Lorsque de mauvaises choses sont faites, le rôle d’un chef est d’en prendre la responsabilité et d’exiger que les gens rendent des comptes ». Si vous maintenez cette déclaration et que vous avez encore du respect pour la fonction que vous avez le privilège d’occuper, pourquoi n’avez-vous pas congédié les membres de votre équipe qui étaient impliqués dans cette affaire?

2. Vous vous êtes levé à la Chambre des communes et avez affirmé ceci au sujet de la décision de Nigel Wright de signer un chèque de  90 000 $ : « aucune information ne m’a été transmise, pas plus qu’aux employés de mon bureau ». Pourtant, la preuve déposée en court révèle que Nigel Wright a adressé un courriel à Benjamin Perrin, l’avocat du Bureau du premier ministre, et à Ray Novak, votre actuel chef de cabinet, précisant qu’il envoyait un chèque personnel. Maintenant que cette preuve est sur la place publique, vous affirmez que la « grande majorité » des membres de votre personnel n’étaient pas au courant au sujet du chèque de Nigel Wright. Qui, précisément, était au courant? Au moment où vous avez fait votre première déclaration, saviez-vous qu’elle était fausse?

3. En ce qui concerne le chèque de 90 000 $, en 2013, vous avez dit : « Le mercredi 15 mai, on m’a informé à son sujet ». Le lendemain, votre bureau a publié une déclaration stipulant que Nigel Wright « a la confiance du premier ministre » et qu’« il ne démissionnera pas ». Des mois plus tard, vous avez dit : « Il a été congédié ». Si vous avez congédié Nigel Wright, pourquoi votre bureau a-t-il publié une déclaration affirmant qu’il avait votre confiance?

4. Depuis que Nigel Wright a quitté votre bureau, le 19 mai 2013, avez-vous, ou un membre de votre personnel, communiqué avec lui au sujet d’un point relevant des affaires gouvernementales?

Les Canadiennes et les Canadiens méritent des réponses à ces questions, réponses que vous avez refusé de donner.

Cordialement,

As one of the leading forces fighting for well-paying, good quality jobs, unions are vital to promoting and protecting our middle class. Hard-working Canadians deserve a government that, instead of attacking unions, works with them to ensure that everyone has a real and fair chance at success. A Liberal government will ensure respect, fairness, and inclusion for Canada’s labour movement by repealing C-377 and C-525; work with provinces and territories, workers, and employers to enhance the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and develop a “made in Canada” solution to solve the skills shortage; present a real plan to update Canada’s infrastructure, which will create jobs and prepare Canada for the changing global economy.

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","Aujourd'hui, il ne tient qu'à vous de changer ensemble.

C'est à vous de voter et de tenir la promesse qu'un meilleur Canada est toujours possible.

J'ai consacré les 78 derniers jours à voyager de part et d'autre du pays pour partager notre plan pour renforcer la classe moyenne. J'ai rencontré des milliers de Canadiennes et Canadiens, fait des dizaines d'annonces de politiques et répondu à des centaines de questions de journalistes.

Les 90 000 bénévoles de l'Équipe Trudeau qui ont frappé aux portes et fait des appels à plus de 11 millions de domiciles ont été une véritable source d'inspiration pour moi.

Maintenant, la campagne électorale la plus longue et la plus disputée de l'histoire canadienne est entre les mains des militant(e)s comme vous.

Peu importe ce que vous avez lu ou entendu, ne tenez rien pour acquis. Vous n'aurez fait votre part qu'après avoir déposé votre bulletin dans l'urne.

En 2011, le sort de 55 circonscriptions a été décidé dans une marge de 5 % et moins; les élections de 2015 sont encore plus serrées.

C'est la raison pour laquelle, aujourd'hui, je compte sur vous pour VOTER, tout comme vos compatriotes.

"21751825648","Justin Trudeau","Today, real change is in your hands.

It's up to you to vote, and deliver on the promise that a better Canada is always possible.

For the past 78 days, I have travelled across Canada sharing our plan to strengthen the middle class. I met thousands of Canadians, made dozens of policy announcements, and answered hundreds of questions from reporters.

And I've been inspired as our team of nearly 90,000 Team Trudeau volunteers made knocks and calls to over 11-million households.

Now the longest, most competitive election in Canadian history comes down to you, our supporters.

Whatever you've read, whatever you've heard, don't take anything for granted. Your part is not done until your vote is in the ballot box.

In 2011, 55 ridings were decided by a margin of 5 percentage points or less, and the 2015 election is even more competitive.

That's why today, I'm counting on you to VOTE, and so are Canadians.

Remember: Voting is easy, and over 3 million Canadians, including many of your neighbours, have already cast their ballot.

Thank you, again, for your support.",2015-10-19 15:55:00,"status",NA,"21751825648_10153796460570649",13799,1133,1449,2015-10-19,"15:55:00","October","Election Day"
